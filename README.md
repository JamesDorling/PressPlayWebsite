# PRESS PLAY SPRING APPLICATION
## Summary
This application is a Springboot website application that interfaces with a database of movies and users.
Created for a fake movie company, this was part of my Sparta training.

Currently functions as both a website and an API, the API receiving GET and POST requests. The UI uses these endpoints to navigate the webpage.

## How to use
Clone the repo and open it in your IDE of choice. This may require the databases to be pre-built, the SQL to do so can be gained from Sparta.
